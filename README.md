# InvoiceSummary

this project was made for giving a quick overview over the budget situation in a school.
Invoices that are scanned have have to use a naming system, starting with their index number, followed by category, department and price. 
The "_" is used a dividing token and a "__" marks the last item in the list.

I added 8 pdf invoices as examples for testing purposes to the project.
